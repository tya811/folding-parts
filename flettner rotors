they are seemingly more versatile than conventional fans, because they seem to be able to withstand greater force without buckling or creating 
copious amounts of drag. 

so like on planes that takeoff on water, have parts of the flettner rotors that you use in the place of flaps and ailerons, become what do the same
thing as propellers on a prop jet, and then taxi at alititude with your regular motors, i don't know if regular motors can take the stresses
of getting wet all the time? i think they can, but salt water is not fun for most engines. 

so you take off under flettner rotor power, and then switch to regular motors and slowly repurpose your flettner rotors as ailerons and flaps.
